# Health Package Decision Log

## Purpose and Maintenance

This document records the reasoning behind significant architectural decisions, feature implementations, and strategic changes made during health package development. It serves as a historical record of what happened and why, capturing both successful decisions and rejected alternatives.

**When to Update**: Add entries for:
- Major architectural changes or refactors
- Significant features implemented or removed
- Technology choices and trade-offs
- Performance optimisations
- Security decisions
- User experience pivots
- Integration decisions (external services, APIs)
- Development process changes

**Entry Format**: Each entry should include the date, a brief context-setting summary, and specific decision points with rationale.

**Chronological Order**: Entries are ordered with most recent first - years in descending order (2025, 2024), and months within each year in descending order (December to January).

**Git History Reference**: Use the last updated timestamp from git log as the baseline when checking git history for changes since this document was last updated.

## 2025-07-30: Project Documentation Structure

**Decision**: Created docs directory and DECISION_LOG.md to track architectural decisions

**Context**: 
- Need structured documentation approach following tripkist patterns
- Important to document the "why" behind implementation decisions
- CLAUDE.md was becoming the single source of truth but needed separation of concerns

**Decision**: 
- Created `docs/` directory for project documentation
- Added `DECISION_LOG.md` to track decision rationale over time
- CLAUDE.md remains focused on development workflow and package architecture
- Documentation references added to CLAUDE.md for discoverability

**Consequences**:
- Future architectural decisions will be documented with context and rationale
- Clearer separation between development guidance (CLAUDE.md) and decision history (docs/)
- Follows established patterns from tripkist project structure

## 2025-07-30: Dynamic Git Attribution in Commits

**Decision**: Use dynamic git config values for commit co-authorship attribution

**Context**:
- Tripkist project uses mandatory collaborative attribution in all commits
- Previously hardcoded "Doug" in commit templates
- Need flexible attribution that works across different developers

**Decision**:
- Updated commit standards to use `$(git config --get user.name)` and `$(git config --get user.email)`
- Maintains collaborative attribution while being developer-agnostic
- Preserves Claude co-authorship requirement

**Consequences**:
- Commit attribution automatically adapts to different git configurations
- Maintains consistency with tripkist collaborative development patterns
- Reduces manual maintenance of commit templates

## 2025-07-30: CLAUDE.md Creation and Workflow Integration

**Decision**: Created comprehensive CLAUDE.md with established workflow patterns

**Context**:
- Need guidance file for future Claude Code instances working on this repository
- Health package needed consistent development patterns and workflows
- Required clear architectural documentation and development standards

**Decision**:
- Created CLAUDE.md with project overview, architecture, and development commands
- Adopted branch management patterns (`{component}_{description}`)
- Integrated test-first development approach
- Added comprehensive testing requirements
- Included collaborative commit attribution standards

**Consequences**:
- Future development will follow consistent patterns
- Clear guidance for Claude Code instances on package architecture
- Established testing and workflow standards for the health package

## 2020-05-16: Go Report Card Integration

**Decision**: Added Go Report Card badge to README for code quality visibility

**Context**:
- Package reached stable state with comprehensive tests and documentation
- Need external validation of code quality standards
- Go Report Card provides automated analysis of Go code quality

**Decision**:
- Added Go Report Card badge to README.md
- Fixed identified typos and formatting issues
- Integrated quality reporting into project presentation

**Consequences**:
- External code quality validation visible to users
- Continuous quality monitoring and improvement feedback
- Professional appearance for open source package

## 2020-05-11: Thread Safety Implementation

**Decision**: Added mutex protection around all write operations to metrics

**Context**:
- Package designed for use in concurrent environments (web servers, containers)
- Race conditions possible with multiple goroutines updating metrics simultaneously
- Need thread-safe operations without compromising performance

**Decision**:
- Implemented global mutex (`var mu sync.Mutex`) for write protection
- Protected `IncrMetric()` and `UpdateRollingMetric()` operations
- Left `Dump()` unprotected for maximum availability during health checks
- Used short critical sections to minimize lock contention

**Consequences**:
- Thread-safe metric updates in concurrent environments
- Maintains high availability for health check endpoints
- Established clear concurrency model for the package

## 2020-05-10: CI/CD Integration

**Decision**: Implemented CircleCI for continuous integration and testing

**Context**:
- Need automated testing for pull requests and commits
- Want consistent test execution across different environments
- Public visibility of build status important for open source adoption

**Decision**:
- Added CircleCI configuration with Go testing pipeline
- Integrated status badge in README for build visibility
- Established automated testing workflow for contributions

**Consequences**:
- Automated quality assurance for all code changes
- Public confidence through visible build status
- Foundation for future deployment automation

## 2020-05-10: Project Foundation and Architecture

**Decision**: Initial implementation of health metrics package with dual metric types

**Context**:
- Need simple, reliable health monitoring for containerized Go applications
- Existing solutions either too complex or lacking key features
- Focus on JSON output for modern monitoring dashboards

**Decision**:
- **Core Architecture**: State struct with simple counters and rolling averages
- **Thread Model**: Single global mutex for write operations, unprotected reads
- **Data Structures**: Maps for counters, circular buffers for rolling metrics
- **Output Format**: JSON serialization for HTTP health endpoints
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive unit tests with race condition testing

**Key Implementation Choices**:
- **Simplicity First**: Two metric types cover majority of use cases
- **Container Focus**: Designed for Kubernetes health check patterns
- **Standard Library Only**: No external dependencies for reliability
- **Defensive Programming**: Invalid inputs ignored rather than causing errors

**Initial File Structure**:
- `health.go` (98 lines): Core State struct and metric operations
- `rolling_metric.go` (26 lines): Circular buffer implementation
- `health_test.go` (128 lines): Comprehensive unit tests
- `rolling_metric_test.go` (37 lines): Rolling average tests
- `doc.go` (54 lines): Package documentation and usage examples

**Consequences**:
- Simple, focused package suitable for immediate production use
- Clear architectural foundation for future enhancements
- Comprehensive test coverage from initial implementation
- Standard Go conventions and idioms throughout
