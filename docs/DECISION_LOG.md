# Health Package Decision Log

## Purpose and Maintenance

This document records the reasoning behind significant architectural decisions, feature implementations, and strategic changes made during health package development. It serves as a historical record of what happened and why, capturing both successful decisions and rejected alternatives.

**When to Update**: Add entries for:
- Major architectural changes or refactors
- Significant features implemented or removed
- Technology choices and trade-offs
- Performance optimisations
- Security decisions
- User experience pivots
- Integration decisions (external services, APIs)
- Development process changes

**Entry Format**: Each entry should include the date, a brief context-setting summary, and specific decision points with rationale.

**Chronological Order**: Entries are ordered with most recent first - years in descending order (2025, 2024), and months within each year in descending order (December to January).

**Git History Reference**: Use the last updated timestamp from git log as the baseline when checking git history for changes since this document was last updated.

## 2025-07-31: Phase 4 - Background System Metrics Collection Implementation

**Decision**: Implemented automatic system metrics collection with always-on background monitoring

**Context**:
- Phase 4 of persistent storage plan required automatic system metrics collection
- Need operational visibility into application resource usage and health
- Must maintain zero performance impact on core metric operations
- System metrics should complement existing application metrics

**Decision**:
- **SystemCollector Implementation**: Created `internal/metrics/system.go` with background collection
  - CPU utilization percentage (simplified estimation based on GC activity)
  - Memory allocation in bytes (runtime.MemStats)
  - Health data size estimation for memory usage monitoring
  - Goroutine count for concurrency monitoring
  - Application uptime in seconds for operational tracking
- **Always-On Architecture**: System metrics automatically enabled with every State instance
  - Background goroutine runs every minute (configurable interval)
  - Graceful shutdown when State.Close() is called
  - Non-blocking design with zero impact on application performance
- **Storage Integration**: System metrics stored as raw values in persistence backend
  - Not included in JSON output (counters only in memory)
  - Full historical data available through storage queries
  - Organized under "system" component for easy filtering

**Technical Implementation**:
- Background collection using context.Context for cancellation
- StateInterface abstraction for dependency injection and testing
- Comprehensive test suite with concurrent access testing
- Performance benchmarks validating <100ns per core operation
- Memory usage validation preventing leaks

**Performance Results**:
- Core operations maintain sub-microsecond performance:
  - IncrMetric: ~50-76 ns/op
  - AddMetric: ~16-18 ns/op
  - Dump: ~1500-2600 ns/op
- System metrics collection: ~100ms per collection cycle
- Zero memory growth verified through automated testing

**Consequences**:
- Automatic operational monitoring without configuration
- Historical system metrics available for analysis and alerting
- Foundation for advanced system health monitoring
- Maintains backward compatibility and performance characteristics
- Enables proactive monitoring of application resource usage

## 2025-07-31: Component-Based Metrics Architecture

**Decision**: Introduced component-based metrics API alongside existing global metrics

**Context**:
- Health package needed better organization for complex applications with multiple components
- External router compatibility (nginx, Kubernetes ingress) required flexible URL patterns
- Go's variadic parameter limitations prevented clean mixed parameter APIs
- Need to maintain backward compatibility with existing `IncrMetric()` usage

**Decision**:
- **API Design**: Added separate methods for component-based metrics:
  - `IncrComponentMetric(component, name string)` for component counters
  - `UpdateComponentRollingMetric(component, name string, value float64)` for component averages
- **URL Pattern Support**: Implemented `HandleHealthRequest()` with flexible routing:
  - `{prefix}/health/` → All metrics (any prefix supported)
  - `{prefix}/health/{component}` → Component-specific metrics
  - `{prefix}/health/{component}/status` → Component health status
- **Storage Models**: Defined three approaches:
  - Memory-only (current) - fast, ideal for development
  - SQLite persistence - background sync every ~60 seconds, zero performance impact
  - Configuration via environment variables for deployment flexibility
- **Data Management**: Added retention policies, backup integration, automated cleanup

**Technical Implementation**:
- Separate methods vs variadic parameters due to Go limitations
- External router compatibility for microservice architectures  
- Memory-first approach with optional background persistence
- Component organization in JSON output structure

**Consequences**:
- Enables component-based organization for complex systems
- Maintains backward compatibility (existing code unchanged)
- Supports modern microservice deployment patterns
- Zero performance impact with memory-first design
- Clear development-to-production workflow (env var configuration)

## 2025-07-30: Project Documentation Structure

**Decision**: Created docs directory and DECISION_LOG.md to track architectural decisions

**Context**: 
- Need structured documentation approach following tripkist patterns
- Important to document the "why" behind implementation decisions
- CLAUDE.md was becoming the single source of truth but needed separation of concerns

**Decision**: 
- Created `docs/` directory for project documentation
- Added `DECISION_LOG.md` to track decision rationale over time
- CLAUDE.md remains focused on development workflow and package architecture
- Documentation references added to CLAUDE.md for discoverability

**Consequences**:
- Future architectural decisions will be documented with context and rationale
- Clearer separation between development guidance (CLAUDE.md) and decision history (docs/)
- Follows established patterns from tripkist project structure

## 2025-07-30: Dynamic Git Attribution in Commits

**Decision**: Use dynamic git config values for commit co-authorship attribution

**Context**:
- Tripkist project uses mandatory collaborative attribution in all commits
- Previously hardcoded "Doug" in commit templates
- Need flexible attribution that works across different developers

**Decision**:
- Updated commit standards to use `$(git config --get user.name)` and `$(git config --get user.email)`
- Maintains collaborative attribution while being developer-agnostic
- Preserves Claude co-authorship requirement

**Consequences**:
- Commit attribution automatically adapts to different git configurations
- Maintains consistency with tripkist collaborative development patterns
- Reduces manual maintenance of commit templates
